# Schmup Wars

alternate version -

Destroy the Bug colony ships before they can land on Earth. 
They don't fire guns. Instead they use hyper-space mines that our bullets can't seem to hit. 
Clearing all the ships from the screen resets your current health to 100%. 

But you won't be able to clear the screen *and* dodge mines at the same time.
